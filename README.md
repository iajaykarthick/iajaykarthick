## Ajay Karthick

AI Solutions Architect building and owning production-grade AI systems under real-world constraints.

### What I work on
- End-to-end AI system design for high-stakes domains where correctness, usability, and auditability matter.
- AI orchestration, validation layers, and deterministic fallbacks for production reliability.
- Document intelligence systems spanning text, structure, graphics, math, and Braille.
- Translating regulatory and domain requirements into concrete, verifiable system behavior.

### Current focus
- Accessibility and document intelligence as a proving ground for rigorous, real-world AI systems.
- Designing AI pipelines that hold up under accuracy, latency, and compliance constraints.
- Building human-in-the-loop tooling that complements AI instead of masking its failure modes.

### Background
- AI Solutions Architect at UNAR Labs
- Former Data Engineer (Eight Sleep, TCS)
- M.S. in Data Science (Northeastern University)

### Interests
- Applied AI systems
- Reliability and correctness in AI
- Domain-agnostic system design
- AI for real users, not demos

I value clear thinking, explicit system boundaries, and engineering decisions that survive production.
